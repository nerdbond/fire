  An undesirable content collection

## Hello

This is a public collection of undesirable content, so you can get a better sense of what's happening in the world without the excess stuff, and see it en masse.

See the [spreadsheet](https://github.com/nerdbond/fire/blob/make/link.csv) for the underlying data. These are displayed on [beat.land/fire](https://beat.land/fire) for now.

  across)

  - racism
  - anti-woman
  - anti-lgtbq+

## Contribute

If you have something recent, or have dug up something important in the past, please open an issue or PR with a link to the content so we can add it to the collection.
