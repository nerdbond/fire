# Contributing to the Project

Thank you so much for wanting or helping to contribute, it means so much and this will hopefully serve as a great resource for other journalists, researchers, and self-learners to figure out what's right and wrong with society for themselves.

_This is a parallel project with the
[seed](https://github.com/wavebond/seed) repo, which itself focuses on
curating structured data of various kinds for use in software projects. This
fire repo is instead collecting and organizing current and historical events for better awareness of things in society._

## Goals

The main goal of this project is to **curate high quality content** regarding the themes and categories outlined in the [readme](https://github.com/wavebond/fire/blob/make/readme.md#content). This in particular means:

- **Videos**: High quality videos of key events.
- **Images**: High quality images of key events.
- **Posts**: Pivotal articles or social media posts.
- **Metadata**: Descriptive metadata for each visual piece of content.

We should approach this from two different angles:

1. **Current events**: Keep a pulse on the most pivotal current events.
2. **Historical events**: Dig up content from important historical events.

In the end we want to build at least 3 pages for each different topic, a topic being like described in the readme:

1. **Timeline page**: A high-level timeline of events in each category, with ideally a date range, a photo, a link to some relevant content, a short title, and one or two classifying tags/categories associated with each event.
2. **Example page**: A curated collection of the most important examples of each topic, with a video or image, a link, a title, and one or two tags similar to the events.
3. **Overview page**: A landing page to draw you into each topic with the top 10 or 20 most centrally important images and videos front and center, linking out to the more detailed example and timeline pages.

## Example Workflow

To do this, I imagine a daily or regular workflow to grab the latest content, and in the down time, researching historical topics to find high quality images. Some places where you can find good information are:

- Reddit threads
- Twitter hashtags
- Facebook
- News sites
- Wikipedia summary posts

Think about it like a [Ken Burns documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1epbIsZLcQ). Ken Burns selects the best most illustrative images and video clips and plays them slowly to a narrative. We don't have to do the narrative part, but collecting high quality content like he does.

The content should be the _best of the best_, regularly filtered out and replacing less pivotal events (on the landing page) with more impactful ones. We shouldn't grab tons of similar content, but keep it diverse. Think about it like you wouldn't want to watch the same video in a slightly different way a dozen times, you would like to see the highlights of the content so to speak. There's not enough time in the day for the average person to watch hours and hours of similar content, they need to get both breadth and depth quickly, so they can make smarter and more productive decisions.

So you can imagine digging into a current event, or digging into a historical event, and collecting 5 or 10 images and videos (along with the title and tags and link) into a spreadsheet, and submitting them in chunks to this project. Whatever piques your interest of the day, focus on that, and find some great quality content.

Make sure the content is socially relevant (following the topics from the [readme](https://github.com/wavebond/fire/blob/make/readme.md#content)). Make sure to gain a balanced perspective as well. And finally, make sure to really get good images and videos if you can, because they hit home the hardest.

## Submissions

Ideally you can submit 5 or 10 chunks of content at a time. A "chunk" means:

- cover photo (if possible)
- video (if possible)
- title (short title to get the point across)
- tags/categories (1 or 2 key tags to organize the content according to the themes)
- link (to the original article or post)

You would **download each image and video**, and make a record of it in a spreadsheet, that's pretty much it.

### Downloading Images and Videos

It is important to download the images and videos, so we can create a more permanent record. Here are some example sites for downloading images and videos from social media sites:

- [Download Videos from Twitter](https://ssstwitter.com/)
- [Download Videos from YouTube](https://en1.y2mate.is/)

You can search the web to find more example sites or browser extensions to help with that. It is important to capture the images and videos so they don't get deleted down the road. I will then publish these to a Twitter feed or something like that down the road.

Facebook and some other sites might make it easier to download their videos, and you can always download the high quality images (not low-quality thumbnails) by right clicking on it. For images, you can also search image sites like Flickr and whatnot, because these are educational/news-oriented goals, so copyright is not a problem. But keep a record of the source of each if you can.

### Create Your Own Spreadsheet

Create a spreadsheet for yourself to work on, and you can continuously add to it as we go. This way I will not end up with 1 spreadsheet for every 5-10 chunks of content, but instead have a growing spreadsheet from each person who contributes to this project! I can use the URL/link in the first column of the spreadsheet as a unique identifier, so I can just download your spreadsheet again and again as it is updated, and sync it to the main website.

The spreadsheet should have these columns, and potentially more if you have more ideas.

- url
- title
- photo_file_name
- video_file_name
- tags
- location (if you can find it)
- author_url (if for a social media post, for example)
- date_range (if you can find the event/history)

For the file_names, create a folder structure such as this, which might be helpful.

```
/contents
  /files
    /files-001
      /random-video-name.mp4
      /random-image.jpg
      /...
    /files-002
      /another-video.mp4
      /another-image.png
      /...
  /records.xlsx
```

This way, you can send me a `.zip` file of each batch of files, along with the latest copy of the spreadsheet called `records.xlsx`, just two files at a time:

- `files-001.zip`: The latest batch of files.
- `records.xlsx`: The current latest copy of the spreadsheet.

You can also just link me to a Google Spreadsheet, and/or a Google Drive set of folders, and I can download it from there, whatever works.

Then I can unzip and run it through my processor to sync the images and records to the website in some ways. That will make it most appropriate for my workflow I think.

## Thinking like a Documentary Maker

When you're gathering your content or finding interesting images and videos about important events and things that are happening, remember to think like a documentarian. Gather only the most important pieces, and otherwise link out to other important articles where people can learn more. The main thing is to collect the videos and images, so we can build a landing page for each topic.

You can take advantage of tools like ChatGPT to figure out what new things you can research (it's memory contains everything before 2021 basically). As you go about your daily life and encounter new social media, keep an eye out for important pieces or things that fit within the themes and topics in the readme, so you can collect them right then and there. Potentially too, we can get content into the site rapidly so things are fresh too, but that is not totally necessary. Having a repository of pages on important events and topics will be useful at any point down the road in the upcoming future.

If you are digging into the negative things, be careful to take breaks and not make it look like you are reading into bad things to outsiders. Make sure to not go too negative or gory into violence, so these images and videos can be consumed by a somewhat wide audience. But at the same time, people need to see what is happening, so we can't hide everything.

Also spend time looking into the positive side of things. If you listen to podcasts on the relevant topics and themes, or see in the news something happening, record it into your spreadsheet and download an image/video or two to capture it. Things like protests for human rights, initiatives take by people to help the planet through climate change solutions, or political or legal changes that, if nothing else, at least make a decision to try and help us move in a hopefully better direction.

If it's misinformation you are trying to combat, having this central repository will be valuable to show examples and timelines on how things actually were and are in the real-life world.

## Conclusion

This will be a fun, possibly long-term or more regular/continuous project to work on, slowly gathering and curating important content related to social dynamics so that people can better understand the reality of the world we are living in today, and potentially help move toward more peace.

You can do as much or as little as you like, just let me know if you would like to do it more regularly if you want, so we can work out a workflow that fits us both well.

Thank you so much again for being there to contribute to this, I am personally hoping to learn a lot from this, and make it easier for people to get a broad and deep picture of the world as it goes on today.

If you have any questions about what types of content to include, I will keep the readme updated with content categories, but also feel free to ask if you'd like to explore a new avenue, or dig into something that has already been covered again more thoroughly, or just if anything is unclear on the types of content that is being looked for.
